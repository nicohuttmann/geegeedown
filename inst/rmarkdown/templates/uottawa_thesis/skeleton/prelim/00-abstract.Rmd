# Abstract {-}

This is the template for a thesis at the Faculty of Biosciences at 
Heidelberg University. A popular approach to write a thesis or a
paper is the IMRAD method (Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion). This
approach is not mandatory! You can find more information about formal
requirements [here](https://www.bio.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaetbio/en/phd_submission).
