# About this Thesis Template {-}

Welcome to the Heidelberg biosciences thesis template. This template is based on the famous two mandatory  
pages that the Faculty of Biosciences at Heidelberg University requires for dissertations.
It was adapted from [nkurzaw/heididown](https://github.com/nkurzaw/heididown) that 
in turn is based on [phister/huwiwidown](https://github.com/phister/huwiwidown) that 
in turn is based on [ismayc/thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown).


## Why use R Markdown? {-}

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the
beauty of LaTeX. Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX
to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. 

_R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to
visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and
commentary on the results of your project. Using _R Markdown_ will also allow
you to easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the 
resulting plots and output included as well.
